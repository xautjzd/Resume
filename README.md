Resume

## Introduction

Resume.tex is my resume source file to generate pdf format.The template is copied from [writeLaTex](https://www.writelatex.com/).I use CTEX(Chinese Tex) to write and compile my resume.It's compiler is [MiKTex](http://miktex.org/) and default editor is WinEdt. But WinEdt is not free, if you want to use, you must pay for it.So I finally select [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/), but I also recommand you [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).

I mainly use LaTex to write my resume, and have a taste of its magical effect.Next, I will try to use it to write my blog.

## How to built it?

execute `pdflatex resume.tex` to generate resume.pdf
